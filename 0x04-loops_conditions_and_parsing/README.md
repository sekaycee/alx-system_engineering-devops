# Loops, conditions and parsing

Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to learn about loops (`while`, `until` and `for`), condition statements (`if`, `else`, `elif` and `case`), shebangs and how to create SSH keys with **Bash**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash
* Tested on Ubuntu
