# What happens when...

### ...you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter

Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to write a blog post on what happens when I type `https://www.google.com` in my browser. It brings together all I've learnt so far about DNS, TCP/IP, Firewall, HTTPS/SSL, Load-balancer, Web server, Application server, Database etc.
