# Firewall

Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** programm at **ALX**. It aims to learn about firewalls, types of firewalls, firewall setup, config and debugging.

## Tools

* Firewall setup and configuration was done using `ufw`
* Firewall debugging was done with `telnet` and `curl`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
